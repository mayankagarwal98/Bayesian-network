New admissions to IIIT are about to begin and having experienced a number of
things in IIIT till now (from best to worst), you want to suggest a person whether
he/she should join IIIT or not. There are a number of factors affecting this- your view
of academics, college life, recognition, satisfaction, conditions in other colleges, etc.
Model a Bayesian net to find the chances you will recommend IIIT to an outsider.
Give conditional probabilities and justify
